# Enable new Windows update notification

(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-wufb-csp-mdm#user-settings-for-notifications)

With the latest Windows Update versions, the restart notifications for users have changed. This registry key is set so that users again receive a banner/notification that a restart is pending. 

The registry key activates the feature Windows Update/Advanced options/Notify me when a restart is required to finish updating. There is no Intune policy for the setting.
